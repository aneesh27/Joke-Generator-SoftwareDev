# funny haha maker
**Aplication Description**

This application utilizes the joke APIs icanhazdadjoke, YOMOMMA, Blauge.xyz, Geek Jokes, and Bread Puns in order to provide swift access to hilarious jokes. Each user can create their own personal account, including the ability to set up a profile picture! Users can generate as many jokes as they want from the mentioned APIs 15 jokes at a time! These jokes are then displayed in an easy-to-read format that features a save function with each joke. Every single joke that is generated can be saved to a userâ€™s account, which they can then view later under the saved page. Once a user has gotten all the laughs they can out of a joke, they can unsave jokes that they have previously saved. If in the future the joke once again tickles the funny bone, it can be resaved. Saved jokes are unique to each user, and several users can save and unsave the same jokes as much as they see fit. If a user no longer fancies their username, profile picture, or password, all of these can be edited within the profile page. With the easy-to-use navigation bar, feel free to peruse the application!
